# SimpleEAs
Python library for some simple Evolutionary Algorithms.
These follow an ask/tell work flow where one:
- new trial members/sample are requested using ask(), these need to me manually evaluated
- the fitness socores are then fed back to the object with tell() to enable a population update

Future updates will include tools:
- Page Trend test for convergence statistical analysis

## Algorithms


### DE
Differential Evolution (DE) is an easily implemented and effective optimisation algorithm for exploiting real-world parameters. 
DE is a derivative-free, stochastic, population-based, heuristic direct search method [1] which only requires a few robust control variables. 

A simple work flow might be:
```
from pyeas import DE

# call object passing in hyperparameters and bounderies for each optimisable parameter
optimizer = DE(mut=0.6,
               crossp=0.6,
               bounds=np.array([[-5,5],[-5,5]]),

for generation in range(num_gens):

    # ask for a trial population
    trial_pop = optimizer.ask(loop=generation)

    # Loop through trial pop and evaluate their fitnesses 
    solutions = []
    for trial in trial_pop:
        fitness = f(trial)
        solutions.append((value))
    
    # Tell the object the evaluated values.
    optimizer.tell(solutions, trial_pop)

```

### OpenAI ES
Evolutionary Strategies (ES) involve the evaluation of a population of real valued genotypes (or population members), after which the best members are kept, and others discarded.

Natural Evolutionary Strategies (NES) are a family of Evolution Strategies which iteratively update a search distribution by using an estimated gradient on its distribution parameters.
Notably, NES performs gradient accent along the natural gradient.

The OpenAI Evolutionary Stratergy (OAIES) algorithm is a type of NES [2], implemented here as vanilla gradient decent, with momentum, or with adam optimiser [3].

A simple work flow might be:
```
from pyeas import OAIES

# call object passing in hyperparameters and bounderies for each optimisable parameter
optimizer = OAIES(alpha=0.01,
                 sigma=0.002,
                 bounds=np.array([[-10,10],[-10,10]]),
                 population_size=20,
                 optimiser = 'adam',
                 seed=1)

for generation in range(num_gens):

    # ask for a pseudo-population
    trial_pop = optimizer.ask(loop=generation)

    # Loop through pseudo-pop and evaluate their fitnesses 
    solutions = []
    for trial in trial_pop:
        fitness = f(trial)
        solutions.append((value))
    
    # Tell the object the evaluated values.
    optimizer.tell(solutions, trial_pop)

    # Calc the new parent fitness, and tell again!
    parent_fit = f(optimizer.parent)
    optimizer.tellAgain(parent_fit)
    
```

## Additional Functionality

### Groupings

You might not always want a population member to be a 1d array with a corresponding boundary array. e.g., 
- member: [-0.5, -1.9, 1.6, -2, 8], 
- boundaries: [ [-1,1], [-2,2], [-2,2], [-10,10], [-10,10] ]

Instead, we might want to group a member into sub arrays corresponding to a list of boundaries. We can do this using the 'groupings' argument. e.g., 
- member: [[-0.5], [-1.9, 1.6], [-2, 8]], 
- boundaries: [ [-1,1], [-2,2], [-10,10] ]
- grouping: [1, 2, 2]


### Number of Evaluations

The number of evaluations performed (recorded when the object is told solutions) is tracked.
This means that systems can be compared for there computational consumption, rather then just the number of generations/iterations performed.

This is very important to enable realistic comparisons in case mini-batching is being used [4].
